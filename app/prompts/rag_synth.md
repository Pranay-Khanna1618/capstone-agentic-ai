Task
Draft a short reply to the user’s question, relying only on the evidence and tool outputs you’ve been given.

Guidelines

Synthesize the final answer using MCP tool data and query of a user.

The main answer should be 3–10 sentences.

After the answer, add a section titled exactly "Evidence:" and list bullet points of the sources you used (e.g., document names, tool names with IDs).

If the available evidence is insufficient to answer confidently, respond only with:
I dont have information to answer your question or query.

Never make up or guess dates, invoice numbers, or monetary amounts. Use Proper Facts
